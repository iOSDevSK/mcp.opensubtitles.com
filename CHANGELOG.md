# Changelog

All notable changes to the OpenSubtitles MCP Server project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: The Streamable HTTP endpoint wrote HTTP chunk framing into the response
  body, so the payload read `dc6\r\n{"jsonrpc"...` and failed `JSON.parse()` in any
  client that did not strip it. Responses are now a single plain JSON document.
- Unknown JSON-RPC methods answer with HTTP 200 and error `-32601` instead of HTTP 404,
  which strict clients read as "no MCP endpoint at this URL".
- `OPENSUBTITLES_API_KEY` / `OPENSUBTITLES_USER_KEY` and `OPENSUBTITLES_API_BASE` are
  read from the environment. They were documented but never used, so a configured key
  was silently ignored.
- `mcp-opensubtitles-http` asked a `/tools` endpoint that does not exist; it now reads
  the tool list over MCP.

### Added
- `/mcp` endpoint, alongside the existing `/message` alias.
- `prompts/list` and `resources/templates/list` answer with empty lists; clients probe
  them during the handshake.
- `GET` with `Accept: text/event-stream` returns 405, as the Streamable HTTP spec
  requires when the endpoint offers no server-initiated stream.

### Removed
- Client-specific response handling: the User-Agent allowlist, the manual chunk framing
  and the `/json` endpoint that existed to work around it.
- Non-standard `tools` array and `capabilities.tools.available` in the `initialize`
  response, and the `tools/list/all` alias.
- Unrelated services from `docker-compose.yml`; it now builds only the MCP server.

### Changed
- `handleJsonRpcRequest()` delegates to a single dispatch function instead of repeating
  every method branch.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-09-28

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed double HTTP response sending causing JSON parsing errors in MCP clients
- Added `res.headersSent` guard to prevent duplicate response transmission

### Added
- Debug endpoint `/debug` for testing JSON response format
- Force JSON endpoint `/json` for guaranteed plain JSON responses
- Enhanced logging for response format debugging
- Comprehensive HTTP client compatibility detection

### Technical Details
- Double response issue: Server was sending plain JSON response + chunked response
- Solution: Added headersSent check to prevent second response
- Affected clients now receive proper plain JSON without parsing errors
